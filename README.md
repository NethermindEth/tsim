# Starknet Transaction Simulator

Welcome to the Starknet Transaction Simulator documentation!

### Overview

The Starknet Transaction Simulator is a tool designed to simulate transactions on the Starknet network, allowing developers to test and debug their smart contracts and transactions in a controlled environment.

### Getting Started

To get started with the Starknet Transaction Simulator, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

```
cd tsim-fe

bun install
bun run dev

or

npm install
npm run dev
```

Make sure to run the backend server at https://github.com/NethermindEth/starknet-simulator. See the README there for instructions.

### Usage

To use the simulator, you need to:

1. Write your Cairo code in the Editor
2. Compile your code
3. Declare and Deploy your contract
4. Interact with your contract.
5. If the simulation throws an error, you can use the debugger to step through the code and inspect the state of the contract execution.
